## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze user behavior with platform features like “Scan & Pay”, “Points Tracker”, etc.
- Perform advanced data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Derive conversion trends, satisfaction levels, and feature usage patterns
- Visualize key insights using **Power BI**
- Build SQL queries for deeper product and segment analysis
